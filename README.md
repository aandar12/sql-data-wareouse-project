# sql-data-wareouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling and analytics.
# My SQL Data Warehouse Project

## Overview
This project showcases my expertise in building enterprise-grade data warehouses using SQL Server and implementing medallion architecture patterns. Through this project, I demonstrate proficiency in ETL development, data modeling, and analytical reporting.

## My Approach & Methodology

### Business Understanding
I began by analyzing the business requirements for consolidating sales data from multiple source systems (ERP and CRM) to enable comprehensive analytics and reporting.

### Technical Implementation

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Medallion Architecture**: Implemented Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for data processing
- **Star Schema Design**: Created optimized dimensional models for analytical queries
- **Data Quality Framework**: Built comprehensive validation and cleansing processes

#### Key Components I Developed
1. **Bronze Layer Scripts**: Raw data ingestion with minimal transformation
2. **Silver Layer Processing**: Data cleansing, standardization, and business rule application
3. **Gold Layer Analytics**: Dimensional modeling and aggregated reporting tables

## My Technical Contributions

### Custom ETL Processes
```sql
-- Example of my data validation approach
-- This is how I handle data quality in the Silver layer
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_ValidateCustomerData
AS
BEGIN
    -- My custom validation logic here
    -- Check for duplicate customers
    -- Validate email formats
    -- Ensure required fields are populated
END
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented indexing strategies for analytical queries
- Created partitioning schemes for large fact tables
- Optimized ETL processes for incremental loads

### Data Quality Measures
- Built comprehensive data profiling queries
- Created automated quality check procedures
- Implemented exception handling and logging

## Key Insights & Analytics

### Customer Behavior Analysis
I developed SQL queries to analyze:
- Customer lifetime value calculations
- Purchase pattern identification
- Customer segmentation analysis

### Product Performance Metrics
My analytical queries revealed:
- Top-performing product categories
- Seasonal sales trends
- Inventory optimization opportunities

### Sales Trend Analysis
- Month-over-month growth calculations
- Regional performance comparisons
- Sales forecasting data preparation

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **SQL Development**: Advanced T-SQL programming, stored procedures, functions
- **Data Architecture**: Medallion architecture implementation, star schema design
- **ETL Development**: Extract, Transform, Load processes with error handling
- **Data Modeling**: Dimensional modeling, fact and dimension table design
- **Performance Tuning**: Query optimization, indexing strategies
- **Data Quality**: Validation frameworks, exception handling

## Challenges Solved

### Data Integration Issues
- **Challenge**: Inconsistent customer identifiers across ERP and CRM systems
- **My Solution**: Developed fuzzy matching logic and master data management approach

### Performance Optimization
- **Challenge**: Slow analytical queries on large datasets
- **My Solution**: Implemented columnar indexes and query optimization techniques

### Data Quality Management
- **Challenge**: Missing and inconsistent data across source systems
- **My Solution**: Built comprehensive data profiling and cleansing framework
